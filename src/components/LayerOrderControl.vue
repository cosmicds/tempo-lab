  "tempo-no2": `<h3>TEMPO Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) Data Layer</h3>
                <br/>
                This data layer shows the amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) in the lower part of the Earth’s atmosphere, called the troposphere. This measurement represents the total number of nitrogen dioxide molecules in a column of air above one square centimeter on the Earth’s surface (molecules/cm2). NO<sub>2</sub> is an air pollutant that can affect both air quality and human health. It is produced by burning fossil fuels (ie. vehicles and power plants), fires, and even lightning.
                <br/><br/>
                TEMPO’s sensor captures this data at about 2 km by 4.75 km at the center of the field of regard (FOR). The data is processed into a Level 3 product with a resolution of 0.02 by 0.02 degrees, and the imagery you see is displayed at about 2 km resolution. To ensure accuracy, the layer is filtered, and only includes high-quality data points, based on key quality checks and sunlight conditions (solar zenith angle).`,
  "tempo-hcho": `<h3>TEMPO Formaldehyde (HCHO) Data Layer</h3>
                 <br/>
                 This layer shows the total amount of formaldehyde in a vertical column of Earth’s atmosphere. The measurement represents the number of formaldehyde molecules in a column of air above each square centimeter of Earth’s surface. Formaldehyde is a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC), a major category of air pollutant that impacts human health and is a precursor to ozone. It is produced by natural sources (trees) as well as man-made sources, such as exhaust from cars, manufacturing plants, and oil and gas extraction.
                 <br/><br/>
                 TEMPO collects this information at about 2 km by 4.75 km near the center of its viewing area. The data is processed into a Level 3 product with a resolution of 0.02 by 0.02 degrees. The imagery you see is displayed at about 2 km resolution. To ensure accuracy, the layer only includes high-quality data points, filtered using key quality checks, sunlight conditions, and cloud coverage.`,
  "tempo-o3": `<h3>TEMPO Ozone (O3) Data Layer</h3>
               <br/>
               This layer shows the total amount of ozone in a vertical column of Earth’s atmosphere, measured in Dobson Units (DU). In the upper atmosphere, ozone plays an important role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, but in the troposphere ozone is an air pollutant that can affect plant, animal, and human health. Ozone in the troposphere is produced when NO<sub>2</sub> and volatile organic compounds, like HCHO interact in sunlight.
               <br/><br/>
               TEMPO collects ozone measurements at about 2 km by 4.75 km near the center of its viewing area. The data is processed into a Level 3 product with a resolution of 0.02 by 0.02 degrees, and the imagery you see is displayed at about 2 km resolution. To ensure accuracy, the layer only includes high-quality data points, filtered using sunlight conditions (solar zenith angles less than 80°).`,
  "hms-fire": `This layer displays where potential fires have been identified using data from the NOAA Hazard Mapping System. Multiple satellites are used to detect these active fires. However, these sensors are sensitive to both heat sources and reflected sunlight. Industrial sources like steel mills and reflective surfaces like solar panels may create similar signals, but are typically filtered out during data processing. Fire detections can be impacted by environmental factors including cloud cover, dense smoke, and the terrain.
                <br/><br/>
                The colors represent the fire’s radiative power (FRP), which is a measure of the heat energy released by the fire, expressed in megawatts (MW). Higher FRP values often indicate more intense burning within a group of fire pixels, though these values can vary depending on imaging conditions. If FRP data isn’t available for a location, a placeholder value is used.

  "aqi-layer-aqi": `This layer shows the air quality index (AQI) using six color coded categories, each representing a range of values. Higher AQI values indicate higher levels of air pollution.  The AQI for each pollutant is based on health standards set for that pollutant and the scientific information that supports that standard. For ozone, the AQI is calculated on an 8-hour average while for particle pollution it uses a 24-hour average. The reported AQI is the highest AQI value for any of the five measured pollutants.
